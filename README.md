# text-to-keywords


```
This is a 'text to keywords' application using Headai's APIs, built on Python, returning JSON. This project was 
made during my summer internship with Headai, where I learned how to use their APIs, as well as do
documentation. The application accepts a PDF/DOCX file, extracts the text, and returns keywords using Headai's
APIs.

1. Configuration instructions
  This application can be run on a Linux or Windows environment, and uses standard Python language libraries as well 
  as user defined libraries.
  No virtual environment (venv) is needed to run this, but it also works with a venv.
  This program runs on "localhost:5000".

2. Installation instructions
  All the files required to run this application are already present.
  Please make sure you delete all files in 'uploads' folder before
  running (i.e. everytime the program is run, 'uploads' should be 
  empty'.
	
  NOTE- make sure you store 'index.html' in 'templates' folder, which
  is in the same location where the program runs from (either C:/ or
  D:/ in Windows). Also make sure you have an 'uploads' folder present
  in the same location.
